# 🚀 Full-Stack Developer Roadmap

A step-by-step guide to becoming a **Full-Stack Developer** with the right skills and projects.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Strengthen Fundamentals (Next 3 Months)

### 📌 Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Master **React** (state management, hooks, component lifecycle).
- Build a **real-world project** (e.g., an interactive dashboard or a portfolio with admin access).
- Learn **Tailwind CSS + UI libraries (Shadcn/UI, Material-UI)** for modern design.

### 📌 Backend (Node.js with Express OR Django with Python)
- Choose between **Django (Python)** or **Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)**.
- Learn **RESTful APIs, authentication (JWT, OAuth), and middleware**.
- Create a **backend service** (e.g., a task manager API with authentication).

### 📌 Database (SQL & NoSQL)
- Learn **PostgreSQL (for Django) OR MongoDB (for Node.js)**.
- Understand **CRUD operations, schema design, and database indexing**.
- Build a **User Authentication System** with login/signup, roles, and session management.

## ✅ Phase 2 – Build & Deploy Full-Stack Projects (Next 6 Months)

### 📌 Intermediate Full-Stack Projects:
1️⃣ **Full-Stack To-Do App** (React + Django/Node.js + MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
2️⃣ **E-commerce Platform** (Product listing, cart, payment integration)
3️⃣ **Freelancer Dashboard (TaskNest Feature)** – A real-world project for your freelancing platform!

### 📌 APIs & Third-Party Integrations:
- Learn how to **consume and create APIs** (OpenWeather, Stripe, etc.).
- Add **authentication (JWT, OAuth)** and **role-based access**.

### 📌 Deployment & DevOps:
- Learn **Docker & CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Netlify, Vercel).
- Deploy projects on **Heroku, Render, or AWS**.

---

## ✅ Phase 3 – Career & Advanced Concepts (Next 1 Year)

### 📌 Advanced Topics:
- **GraphQL APIs** (for optimized API calls).
- **Microservices architecture** (for scalable systems).
- **WebSockets** (for real-time applications like chat apps).

### 📌 Portfolio & Job Readiness:
- **Improve your portfolio** (with case studies & live projects).
- **Contribute to open-source** and build a strong **GitHub profile**.
- **Apply for full-stack roles & internships** (LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr).

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines – Automate Deployment!

### 🔹 What is CI/CD?
**CI (Continuous Integration)** automates **testing** whenever you push changes.  
**CD (Continuous Deployment)** automates **deploying** your app to production.

### 🔹 Tools for CI/CD:
✅ **GitHub Actions** – Best for GitHub projects  
✅ **GitLab CI/CD** – Used for GitLab projects  
✅ **Vercel, Netlify** – For frontend projects  
✅ **Heroku, Render, AWS** – For full-stack apps  

### 🔹 Example: Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: |
          npm install -g vercel
          vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
📌 **How it works?**
✅ **Runs on every push** to `main` branch.  
✅ **Installs dependencies, runs tests**, then deploys to **Vercel** automatically.

## 🎯 Next Steps
✅ Pick your backend stack: **Django or Node.js?**  
✅ Start a **full-stack project** ASAP.  
✅ Work on **authentication, databases, and API integrations**.  

🚀 Stay consistent, and you'll be a **pro full-stack developer** soon! 💪
